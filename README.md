# Motion-Detection-and-Capture
## Description
This project involves creating a motion detection camera system using a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor, an ESP32-CAM development board, the Telegram API, and the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The system will detect motion using the PIR sensor, capture images or videos with the ESP32-CAM when motion is detected, and then send the captured media to a Telegram chat using the Telegram API.
